Movie Web Application
This project is a simple, responsive web application designed to display a list of movies. Users can search for movies, view movie details, and navigate through pages of movie listings. The interface is designed using HTML and CSS, with a focus on clean, modern design principles such as flexbox layouts, hover effects, and CSS transitions.

Features
Movie Listing: Displays a list of movies with thumbnails and information such as title and rating.
Search Functionality: A search bar allows users to filter movies by name.
Movie Overview: Hovering over a movie shows more detailed information (description) with a smooth slide-up animation.
Pagination: Users can navigate between different pages of movie listings.
Tags: Includes clickable tags to filter movies based on categories or genres.
Mobile Responsive: The layout adjusts to fit various screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop.
Overlay Menu: A hidden menu that can be toggled on or off, providing additional navigation options.
Arrows and Dots Navigation: Navigational arrows and dots for easy interaction with movie content.

CSS3: Used for styling, with advanced features such as custom properties (variables), flexbox, and transitions.
JavaScript (optional): Can be used for adding interactivity like dynamic movie search and pagination.
How to Use
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-web-app.git
Open the index.html file in your browser.

Explore the movie listings, search for a specific movie, and view detailed information by hovering over the movie card.

Customization
Fonts: The project uses Google Fonts (Poppins), which you can easily customize by modifying the @import link in the CSS.
Colors: The primary and secondary colors are defined in the :root section of the CSS. You can adjust these for a different look and feel.
Movie Data: Movie images, titles, and descriptions are currently hard-coded in the index.html file. You can replace these with your own content or integrate with a movie API to fetch dynamic data.
Future Enhancements
API Integration: Connect the project to a movie database API like The Movie Database (TMDb) to fetch real-time movie data.
User Authentication: Add login and user authentication to allow users to save favorite movies or create watchlists.
Additional Filters: Implement more advanced filtering options such as genre, release date, and rating.
